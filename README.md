# Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and TSNE
## Dataset: MNIST Dataset
## Objective:- Reduce 784D data to 2D and ploting their graphs

## Results
1. The size of a cluster does not mean much with the tSNE, while it has a meaning in the case of the PCA
2. PCA preserves the global structure of the data while TSNE preserve the local (cluster) structure of data.
3. TSNE outperformed PCA involving Hyperparameters such as perplexity, learning rate and number of steps.
